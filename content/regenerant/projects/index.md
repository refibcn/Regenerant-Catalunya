# Participating Projects

Regenerant Catalunya unites a diverse cohort of local projects under one funding umbrella. Projects were scouted and invited by our partners based on proven regenerative commitment and openness to learning. These projects exemplify the **network-driven approach** described in our Theory of Change, showing how trusted local partners ([Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/) and [La Fundició](https://lafundicio.net/)/[Keras Buti](https://kerasbuti.org/)) have identified exemplary projects within their networks.

## Projects invited by Miceli Social

### Regeneració.XYZ - Communicating Regeneration

A creative agency at the intersection of **art, regeneration, and rural narratives**. Born out of a community project in La Garrotxa, Regeneració is crafting new narratives for regeneration through artistic expression. They have been recognized by Culture Hack Labs' *Rhizome* program as a pioneer in *bioregional community governance*.

### [Resilience Earth](https://resilience.earth/) & [Simbiosi Fluvial](https://balkar.earth/fluvia/) - Bioregional Governance & Digital River Stewardship

**Resilience Earth** is a worker cooperative working on **bioregional governance and digital river stewardship**. [Resilience Earth](https://resilience.earth/) has been working for years with more than a hundred municipalities across Catalonia, co-designing democratic public policies rooted in **bioregional governance**. Building on this deep track record, the organization now seeks to take a step further by **experimenting with novel technologies** to enhance ecological decision-making.

Through the **Fluvià River project**, they want to apply blockchain and AI systems to **improve environmental data collection and analysis**, creating a digital infrastructure that can feed directly into governance processes for the river basin.

### [De Bat a Bat](http://www.debatabat.org/) - Community Health

De Bat a Bat is developing a regenerative model of community health that is holistic, participatory, and rooted in nature, supported by Erasmus+ and LIFE funding. They collaborate with health centers, schools, and associations, and aim to expand into therapeutic leisure and holiday programs for rural patients.

### [Chapter#2](https://chapter2.cat/) - Education & Art

This initiative brings regenerative storytelling into schools, helping them recover their link with place and co-create artistic figures celebrating each school's identity. The process aims to heal past traumas and reveal the regenerative potential of educational communities.

### [Anigami](https://www.anigami.cat/) - Regenerative Tourism

Anigami is advancing regenerative tourism models in Catalonia, combining Erasmus+ funding with a training program in regenerative tourism to be shared with Balkar.Earth's learning community.

### [Les Juntes](https://www.lesjuntes.coop/) - Cooperative Housing and Urban Regeneration

Les Juntes is a **cooperative housing** project under a "use-right" model (*cesión de uso* in Spanish, not perfectly translatable). Its aim is to recover housing currently held by investment funds in the northern area of L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, in order to guarantee the right to secure housing through collective and shared ownership structures that resist the commodification of a good that should ensure the housing sovereignty of local residents.

### [La Suculenta](https://www.instagram.com/suculentalh/?hl=es) - Food sovereignty & social inclusion

La Suculenta is a community dining initiative at the **Casal Cívic Comunitari de Bellvitge**. It focuses on offering affordable meals prepared with ecological and locally sourced ingredients, while also providing hospitality training and employment opportunities to people who have suffered violations of their fundamental rights.

### La Granja del Tilo - Agroecology & generational renewal

La Granja del Tilo is a worker cooperative running an **organic egg farm** in the **Parc Agrari del Baix Llobregat**. The initiative works to ensure generational renewal in farming by creating structures that support young farmers and recovering agricultural land in the Delta del Llobregat. Its goal is to resist urban development pressure and preserve the agroecological systems of the delta.

## Selection Criteria

The project scope reflects a broad regeneration definition: from ecological restoration and community projects to regional civic innovation and educational initiatives. We prioritized projects involving ecological restoration and community empowerment that could be good testing cases and benefit from the use of the web3 tools for impact we are promoting. We explicitly avoided profit-driven businesses, maintaining community-centricity, cooperative approach and public-good orientations to ensure cohort coherence.
