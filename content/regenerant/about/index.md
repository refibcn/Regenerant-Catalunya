# About Regenerant Catalunya

**Regenerant Catalunya** is a pioneering participatory funding round that demonstrates how **local knowledge can integrate with global Web3 infrastructure** to create a replicable model for bioregional regeneration. Through collaboration between established Catalan partners ([Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/), [La Fundició](https://lafundicio.net/)/[Keras Buti](https://kerasbuti.org/)) and global Web3 funders (Gitcoin, Celo, Ethereum Foundation), we're channeling **€30,000 into 10-12 carefully curated regenerative projects** across Catalonia.

## What Makes It Unique

Rather than imposing external blockchain solutions, we **build within trusted ecosystems**, empowering exemplary projects to generate visible success stories that inspire wider adoption of regenerative finance mechanisms. Each project receives funding plus capacity-building in Web3 tools, creating ongoing infrastructure for bioregional regeneration.

## Timeline

**Launch:** October 14-28, 2025 during Gitcoin Grants Round 24, followed by comprehensive capacity-building and impact measurement through proven methodologies adapted from Regen Coordination's successful GG23 round.

## Vision

This isn't just about funding projects—it's about **building the infrastructure for ongoing bioregional regeneration** while creating open-source knowledge products that can be adapted globally. The combination of traditional cooperative values with cutting-edge Web3 tools positions Regenerant Catalunya as a **bridge between worlds**, proving blockchain technology can serve real community needs rather than speculation.

## A Participatory Funding Round for Regeneration in Catalonia

*Ronda de Finançament Participatiu Bioregional a Catalunya*

**Regenerant Catalunya** is an upcoming participatory funding round dedicated to channeling resources into projects that are regenerating life in the Catalan bioregion. From conserving and restoring natural ecosystems like the Fluvià River basin to developing community infrastructure in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat — Catalonia's second most populous municipality and one of Europe's most densely populated cities — this initiative aims to **support on-the-ground regenerative work** across the region.

The program is led by **ReFi Barcelona** as a bridge between local needs and global support, providing selected local projects with funding **matched by global Web3 partners**. In return, these projects will **experiment with novel technologies and financial tools** (e.g. blockchain-based community funding, digital impact tracking) that could open new income streams and improve their long-term impact.

Both the funding pool *and* the activities of Regenerant Catalunya emerged through a mediation of local and global interests. Established Catalan regenerative networks like **Miceli Social** and **La Fundició** have together committed around **€11,000**, an amount that will be **matched by global sponsors** including Gitcoin, Celo, and the Ethereum Foundation – bringing the total pool to nearly **€30,000**, which will be used to directly support 10-12 regenerative projects in Catalonia.

## Get Involved

*If you are a funder or technical partner interested in supporting the regeneration of the Catalan bioregion, we invite you to **[contact us](mailto:hola@refibcn.cat)** to explore how you can contribute to the matching pool or support the educational and technical activities. This round is only the beginning — the first of many initiatives to empower bioregional regeneration in Catalonia — and we look forward to collaborating with all those aligned on this long-term journey.*
