# A. Introduction Article

## üéØ TLDR

**Regenerant Catalunya** is a pioneering participatory funding round that demonstrates how **local knowledge can integrate with global Web3 infrastructure** to create a replicable model for bioregional regeneration. Through collaboration between established Catalan partners ([Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/), [La Fundici√≥](https://lafundicio.net/)/[Keras Buti](https://kerasbuti.org/)) and global Web3 funders (Gitcoin, Celo, Ethereum Foundation), we're channeling **‚Ç¨30,000 into 10-12 carefully curated regenerative projects** across Catalonia.

**What makes it unique:** Rather than imposing external blockchain solutions, we **build within trusted ecosystems**, empowering exemplary projects to generate visible success stories that inspire wider adoption of regenerative finance mechanisms. Each project receives funding plus capacity-building in Web3 tools, creating ongoing infrastructure for bioregional regeneration.

**Timeline:** Launch October 14-28, 2025 during Gitcoin Grants Round 24, followed by comprehensive capacity-building and impact measurement through proven methodologies adapted from Regen Coordination's successful GG23 round.

**Vision:** This isn't just about funding projects‚Äîit's about **building the infrastructure for ongoing bioregional regeneration** while creating open-source knowledge products that can be adapted globally. The combination of traditional cooperative values with cutting-edge Web3 tools positions Regenerant Catalunya as a **bridge between worlds**, proving blockchain technology can serve real community needs rather than speculation.

## **1. A Participatory Funding Round for Regeneration in Catalonia - [Introduction]**
***Ronda de Finan√ßament Participatiu Bioregional a Catalunya***

**Regenerant Catalunya** is an upcoming participatory funding round dedicated to channeling resources into projects that are regenerating life in the Catalan bioregion. From conserving and restoring natural ecosystems like the Fluvi√† River basin to developing community infrastructure in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat ‚Äî Catalonia's second most populous municipality and one of Europe's most densely populated cities ‚Äî this initiative aims to **support on-the-ground regenerative work** across the region.

The program is led by **ReFi Barcelona** as a bridge between local needs and global support, providing selected local projects with funding **matched by global Web3 partners**. In return, these projects will **experiment with novel technologies and financial tools** (e.g. blockchain-based community funding, digital impact tracking) that could open new income streams and improve their long-term impact.

Both the funding pool *and* the activities of Regenerant Catalunya emerged through a mediation of local and global interests. Established Catalan regenerative networks like **Miceli Social** and **La Fundici√≥** have together committed around **‚Ç¨11,000**, an amount that will be **matched by global sponsors** including Gitcoin, Celo, and the Ethereum Foundation ‚Äì bringing the total pool to nearly **‚Ç¨30,000,** which will be used to directly support 10-12 regenerative projects in Catalonia.

*If you are a funder or technical partner interested in supporting the regeneration of the Catalan bioregion, we invite you to **contact us to explore how you can contribute** to the matching pool or support the educational and technical activities. This round is only the beginning ‚Äî the first of many initiatives to empower bioregional regeneration in Catalonia ‚Äî and we look forward to collaborating with all those aligned on this long-term journey.*

**üìÖ Note:** Regenerant Catalunya will launch during Gitcoin Grants Round 24 (October 14-28, 2025).

## **2. Why Now? - [Contextualization]**

### **Web3, Public Goods, and Regenerative Finance (ReFi)**

Around the world, new approaches to finance are emerging that bring together transparency, decentralization, and democratic processes in service of solidarity and regeneration. **Web3** ‚Äì the decentralized web powered by blockchain ‚Äì enables communities to directly fund and govern projects without intermediaries, aligning incentives around shared values.

In particular, **Regenerative Finance (ReFi)** has arisen as a movement to reimagine economic systems toward restorative outcomes for people and planet. ReFi projects leverage technologies like blockchain, digital measurement (dMRV), and AI to channel resources into public goods and ecological regeneration, rather than extraction.

A big focus of the Web3 and ReFi ecosystems has been **public goods funding** - promoting the development of open-access resources that anyone can use and that benefit all, while making sure that the development of the ecosystems themselves are appropriately funded.

[Gitcoin Grants](https://grants.gitcoin.co/) is one of the most visible examples of Web3 public-goods funding programs, having distributed over $60 million to projects that create and steward shared resources. Using [quadratic funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting#Quadratic_funding) (QF), it matches community donations with larger pools in a way that rewards broad grassroots support. This platform has supported thousands of initiatives that strengthen communities and ecosystems, inspiring similar experiments worldwide.

### **Regen Coordination: A Global Movement Bridging Scales**

From this Web3 ecosystem, **Regen Coordination** emerged as a global alliance of organizations and networks dedicated to weaving together local experiments into a coherent movement. Founded by **ReFi DAO** and **Greenpill Network** with support from Gitcoin and Celo Public Goods, Regen Coordination spans a constellation of like-minded communities ‚Äì including ReFi DAO Local Nodes, Greenpill Chapters, **Bloom Network**, **The BioFi Project**, **Ma Earth**, **AgroforestDAO**, and many others. All are united by a shared mission to drive ecological, social, and economic regeneration through open collaboration.

Regen Coordination convenes decentralized funding rounds, "sensemaking" processes, and shared toolkits that make grassroots efforts more legible and coordinated globally. In just its first year, this alliance raised and distributed over $370,000 to regenerative communities and local projects across multiple programs.

These experiments align closely with the growing movement of **Ethereum Localism**, which seeks to embed Web3 tools into place-based communities for practical benefit ‚Äî helping neighborhoods, bioregions, and civic networks coordinate resources, measure impact, and strengthen local economies.

Some of Regen Coordination's most relevant programs so far include:
- **Regen Coordination Global Round** in Gitcoin Grants 23 (GG23) - deployed a $96,000 matching pool to support 50 projects working at the intersection of ReFi, Ethereum, and local social-ecological impact
- **ReFi Mediterranean GG23** ‚Äì the first bioregional quadratic funding round across the Mediterranean region
- **Regen Rio de Janeiro GG23** in Brazil. These localized rounds brought Web3 funding tools into specific geographic contexts, engaging many participants new to crypto. In addition, Regen Coordination launched a 
- **Zazelenimo** ‚Äì an urban greening initiative in Split, Croatia. Zazelenimo's upcoming pilot will blend Ethereum-based participatory funding with a *3:1 matching contribution from the local municipal government*, enabling citizen-led tree planting through a public‚Äìprivate‚Äìcommunity capital stack.

These experiments are building momentum toward a **"cosmo-local"** network of grantmaking ‚Äì where global resources and tech meet local knowledge and action.

### **Local Funding Programs in GG24: Catalonia as Pioneer**

Building on these successes, **Gitcoin Grants Round 24 (GG24)** features a dedicated *Local Funding Programs* track, led by **Regen Coordination** in partnership with **Open Civics**. This initiative supports communities worldwide in running credible, high-impact local grant rounds that combine global Web3 infrastructure with place-based knowledge and action.

**Regenerant Catalunya** emerges as one of the flagship pilots in this track, testing how global funding mechanisms can serve real bioregional needs. What makes the Catalan experiment particularly compelling is the convergence of three factors:

**Deep Cooperative Roots:** Catalonia's century-long tradition of cooperativism provides fertile ground for Web3 experiments. The region's vibrant Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) already embodies many ReFi values‚Äîcommons-based initiatives, participatory governance, and ecological restoration‚Äîcreating natural alignment with blockchain-enabled coordination tools.

**Established Regenerative Networks:** Rather than starting from scratch, Regenerant Catalunya builds on existing trust relationships. Organizations like **Miceli Social** (rural resilience) and **La Fundici√≥/Keras Buti** (urban cooperative innovation) have spent years cultivating regenerative projects across the territory. This network-driven approach ensures that Web3 tools serve existing community needs rather than imposing external solutions.

**Strategic Timing:** With the climate crisis accelerating and traditional funding mechanisms proving inadequate, there's urgent need for new approaches to financing ecological and social regeneration. Catalonia's combination of environmental challenges (from Barcelona's density to rural depopulation) and innovative capacity makes it an ideal laboratory for testing **"cosmo-local"** funding approaches‚Äîwhere global resources meet local action.

By documenting this experiment thoroughly, **Regenerant Catalunya** aims to produce open-source templates and lessons that other bioregions can adapt, contributing to a global movement of place-based regenerative finance while addressing immediate needs in the Catalan territory.

## 3. Introducing the Regenerant Catalunya GG24 Round

Regenerant Catalunya emerges from a unique convergence: **established Catalan regenerative networks** meeting **global Web3 funding innovation**. Rather than imposing external solutions, this initiative grows organically from existing relationships of trust and solidarity within Catalonia's vibrant Social and Solidarity Economy.

### **A Network-Driven Approach**

At its heart, Regenerant Catalunya is **intentionally network-driven**. We don't ask communities to adopt unfamiliar tools from scratch. Instead, we introduce innovations gradually within trusted ecosystems, relying on the **rural resilience networks of [Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/)** and the **urban cooperative fabric nurtured by [La Fundici√≥](https://lafundicio.net/) / [Keras Buti](https://kerasbuti.org/)**. This ensures that experiments with ReFi and Web3 flow organically through well-established social infrastructures, reaching other cooperatives, associations, and regenerative actors across the Catalan bioregion.

### **The Collaborative Foundation**

The round brings together three complementary layers:

**Local Anchoring:** [Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/) and [La Fundici√≥](https://lafundicio.net/) / [Keras Buti](https://kerasbuti.org/) have committed ‚Ç¨11,000 combined, ensuring the program is grounded in real territorial needs. Miceli brings deep rural expertise from working with over a hundred municipalities across Catalonia, while La Fundici√≥/Keras Buti contributes urban cooperative innovation from Barcelona's metropolitan area.

**Global Matching:** [Regen Coordination](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/), supported by **Celo Public Goods**, **Gitcoin**, and the **Ethereum Foundation**, provides ~$20,000 in matching funds. This creates a total pool of nearly **‚Ç¨30,000** distributed through quadratic funding mechanisms that amplify community voice.

**Technical Bridge:** [ReFi Barcelona](https://refibcn.cat/) serves as the connecting tissue, combining local trust and cultural understanding with global Web3 expertise. As a cooperative in formation housed at Bloc4BCN, we ensure that blockchain tools serve real community needs rather than speculation.

### **Beyond Traditional Grantmaking**

What makes Regenerant Catalunya distinctive is its **dual purpose**: funding immediate regenerative work while building **long-term capacity for bioregional finance**. Each of the 10-12 participating projects receives not just funding (minimum ‚Ç¨1,000) but also:

- **Capacity-building workshops** covering Web3 fundamentals, impact measurement, and collaborative governance
- **Technical mentorship** from global partners (Celo, Ethereum Foundation, ReFi ecosystem contributors)  
- **On-chain reputation building** through Karma GAP impact reporting
- **Access to optional Web3 tools** for enhanced project capabilities

This comprehensive approach ensures that projects don't just spend their grants‚Äîthey develop ongoing capacity to access future funding streams, attract supporters through transparency, and collaborate as a networked ecosystem.

## 4. How is it actually going to look like?

### **The Project Journey: From Application to Impact**

**October 14-28, 2025:** During **Gitcoin Grants Round 24**, Regenerant Catalunya launches as a featured local round. Our carefully curated cohort of projects‚Äîspanning **ecosystem restoration, community health, education, sustainable tourism, and housing**‚Äîpresents their work to both local and global supporters. The quadratic funding mechanism ensures that broad grassroots support matters more than large individual donations.

**November 2025:** The real work begins. We convene a **kick-off workshop** with all funded projects covering the funding distribution approach, on-chain tool setup (Karma GAP profiles, Web3 wallets on Celo), and mentor connections. Projects receive their initial funding based on impact evaluation scores, with potential for additional rewards tied to continued Web3 tool adoption.

**December 2025 - March 2026:** Projects deliver on their proposed activities while participating in ongoing **educational activities**: community governance sessions, demo days, and tool experimentation workshops. Each project maintains a living, public "project resume" on the blockchain through Karma GAP, making their impact visible and verifiable to future funders.

### **Diverse Projects, Unified Vision**

The project cohort reflects Catalonia's regenerative diversity:

**From Rural Resilience:** [Resilience Earth](https://resilience.earth/) applies blockchain and AI systems to improve environmental data collection for the Fluvi√† River basin. [De Bat a Bat](http://www.debatabat.org/) develops holistic community health models rooted in nature. [Mixit√©](https://www.mixite.cat/) designs new policies for rural housing sustainability.

**From Urban Innovation:** [Les Juntes](https://www.lesjuntes.coop/) creates cooperative housing models that resist commodification. [La Suculenta](https://www.instagram.com/suculentalh/?hl=es) provides affordable ecological meals while training people who have suffered rights violations. [Laurel 31](https://www.instagram.com/laurel31_economiassilvestres/?hl=es) advances textile sustainability in neighborhood contexts.

**From Creative Regeneration:** [Regeneraci√≥.XYZ](https://regeneracio.xyz/) crafts new narratives for regeneration through artistic expression. [Chapter#2](https://chapter2.cat/) brings regenerative storytelling into schools. [Anigami](https://www.anigami.cat/) advances regenerative tourism models.

### **Technology Serving Community**

Rather than imposing complex blockchain systems, we start with **minimal Web3 stack** requirements:

**Confirmed Tools:** All projects use **Karma GAP** for transparent impact reporting and receive **Web3 wallets on Celo** for secure fund management. We provide comprehensive support for wallet setup and secure fund handling.

**Optional Innovations:** Interested projects can experiment with advanced tools like **Silvi** for ecosystem restoration tracking, **Hypercerts** for impact certification, **Gainforest** for AI-powered forest monitoring, or **Sarafu Network** for local currency experimentation.

**Community Infrastructure:** A collective **Notion dashboard** aggregates updates from all projects, while **WhatsApp groups** enable informal progress sharing among participants and supporters.

### **Measuring What Matters**

Our evaluation approach adapts the proven [methodology from Regen Coordination's GG23 round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ai-impactqf-regen-coordination-global-gg23-retrospective/20385), which successfully allocated $96,000 to 50 projects. The process includes:

- **Structured reporting** through Karma GAP following Common Approach frameworks
- **Council evaluation** by human reviewers with relevant expertise  
- **Collaborative criteria definition** with local partners ensuring alignment with Catalan regenerative values

We're exploring a **phased distribution approach**: initial allocation based on impact evaluation, with follow-up rewards for continued Web3 tool adoption‚Äîthe exact structure being finalized with our local partners to best serve project needs.

### **Building Beyond This Round**

Most importantly, Regenerant Catalunya is designed as a **capacity-building process** that extends before and after the funding moment. The open report we'll publish in early 2026 serves both as accountability to sponsors and as a knowledge product for the wider regenerative finance community. 

The goal isn't just to fund 12 projects‚Äîit's to demonstrate that **Web3 tools can directly serve the urgent needs of people and ecosystems** while building the infrastructure for ongoing bioregional regeneration in Catalonia. If successful, 2026 may see Regenerant Catalunya Round 2, or perhaps the birth of a permanent **Bioregional Finance Infrastructure** for Catalonia.

---

## 5. Conclusion ‚Äì Funding the Ecosocial Transition in Catalunya and Beyond

**Regenerant Catalunya** represents more than a funding round ‚Äì it's a **proof of concept for the future of regenerative finance**. By October 2025, when our 10-12 carefully selected projects begin their journey through Gitcoin Grants Round 24, we will be testing a fundamental hypothesis: that **Web3 tools can amplify existing regenerative work** while building capacity for ongoing bioregional coordination.

### **A Living Laboratory for Cosmo-Local Finance**

What makes this experiment compelling is its integration of multiple innovations within a coherent framework. **Karma GAP** transforms project reporting from bureaucratic burden to reputation-building opportunity. **Quadratic funding** ensures that broad community support matters more than large individual donations. **Phased distribution** rewards both immediate impact and continued engagement with regenerative finance tools. Most importantly, the **network-driven approach** ensures that these innovations spread organically through existing relationships of trust and solidarity.

The projects themselves‚Äîfrom [Resilience Earth](https://resilience.earth/)'s blockchain-enhanced river stewardship to [Les Juntes](https://www.lesjuntes.coop/)' cooperative housing models‚Äîdemonstrate the diversity of regenerative work that can benefit from Web3 coordination tools. Each represents a different facet of the **ecosocial transition**: ecological restoration, social innovation, cultural regeneration, and economic transformation.

### **Beyond Catalonia: A Template for Global Adaptation**

The lessons from this round will extend far beyond the Catalan bioregion. By documenting our methodology thoroughly and publishing our findings as **open-source knowledge products** in early 2026, we aim to provide templates that other localities can adapt to their specific contexts. The combination of **Regen Coordination's proven evaluation methodology** with **Catalonia's cooperative tradition** creates a replicable model for place-based regenerative finance.

Already, we can envision how this approach might adapt to different contexts: rural communities using **Silvi** for reforestation tracking, urban cooperatives experimenting with **Sarafu Network** commitment pooling, or bioregional alliances coordinating through **Gardens** streaming mechanisms. The tools exist; what Regenerant Catalunya provides is a **practical pathway for their adoption**.

### **The Longer Arc: Building Permanent Infrastructure**

Looking ahead, 2026 may see the birth of a **Bioregional Finance Infrastructure** for Catalonia‚Äîa more permanent system to continuously channel resources into regenerative projects. Imagine Catalan cooperatives and environmental groups with access to ongoing community funding portals, where impact data flows seamlessly into funding decisions, and where local currencies and credits incentivize regenerative behaviors across society.

This vision is already being seeded by organizations in our current cohort. **ReFi Barcelona was created precisely to connect, support, and amplify these efforts**. Our role is to ensure the spark lit by Regenerant Catalunya grows into a sustained flame of *regenerative finance* powering the eco-social transition of our region and inspiring similar experiments worldwide.

### **Join the Movement**

**Regenerant Catalunya is an open collaboration.** Whether you are a Catalan community member, a Web3 developer, an impact investor, or simply a concerned citizen of the world ‚Äì there are concrete ways to participate:

- **Contribute to the funding pool** during the October 14-28 launch period
- **Follow and support** our participating projects through their Karma GAP profiles  
- **Share insights and feedback** to help refine the methodology for future rounds
- **Adapt our open-source templates** for your own bioregional context
- **Connect with ReFi Barcelona** to explore collaboration opportunities

Every additional euro or token goes directly to the frontlines of regeneration in Catalonia, and through quadratic funding, even small donations can have amplified impact. More importantly, every participant helps prove that **blockchain technology can serve real community needs** rather than speculation.

*Together, let's finance the future we want to see ‚Äì one bioregion at a time.*

# B. Round Design & Details

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Program Scope & Theory of Change [‚úÖ for form]**

#### A. Program Scope
The Regenerant Catalunya round is intentionally scoped to **support a small, curated set of local initiatives** that have high regenerative and network potential. Rather than casting a wide net, the focus is on depth and learning: we work closely with our local partners to select and invite projects doing meaningful work on the ground. Additionally, we aim to stay close to participant projects to identify how Web3 tools could enhance their mission and provide ongoing support throughout the process.

The program includes structured **capacity-building workshops** covering:
- **Web3 fundamentals** ‚Äì helping projects understand the technologies behind the funding process and how they might benefit from them.
- **Impact measurement** ‚Äì introducing tools and practices to make regenerative work more visible, trackable, and fundable.
- **Collaborative governance models** ‚Äì exploring decentralized and cooperative ways of decision-making and resource allocation.
- **Mentorships** connecting projects with technical experts from our global partner network (Celo, Ethereum Foundation, and ReFi ecosystem contributors).

#### B. Theory of Change
By empowering a **small group of exemplary projects** with **funding, technology, connections and knowledge**, we aim to generate **visible success stories** that can inspire wider adoption of regenerative finance (ReFi) and Web3 mechanisms in Catalonia and beyond. These projects will act as living laboratories ‚Äî testing how digital tools for **participatory funding, transparent impact tracking, and collaborative governance** can strengthen real, place-based initiatives.

Our approach is intentionally **network-driven**: rather than asking communities to adopt unfamiliar tools from scratch, we want to introduce innovations gradually and **within trusted ecosystems**. We rely on the **rural resilience networks of Miceli Social** and the **urban cooperative fabric nurtured by La Fundici√≥ / Keras Buti**, ensuring that new practices spread through existing relationships of trust and solidarity. This way, experiments with ReFi and Web3 do not remain isolated pilots but can flow organically through well-established social infrastructures, reaching other cooperatives, associations, and regenerative actors across the Catalan bioregion.

#### C. Who & What is being funded
We aim to fund around **10-12 projects** spanning ecological, social, and cultural regeneration. These include grassroots NGOs, community associations, and cooperative ventures already active in the territory. Concretely, the round supports projects in **ecosystem restoration, community health, education, sustainable tourism, and housing** (detailed in section 3). Each project receives a grant (minimum ‚Ç¨1,000) to boost ongoing work *and* pilot a Web3-related innovation ‚Äì all projects will use Karma GAP to report their activities and impact on-chain, and get support from ReFi Barcelona to explore further use cases, such as on-chain registries for tracking river water quality improvements and community funds distribution for volunteers.

#### D. Who benefits
- **Participant projects** benefit through direct financial support and capacity-building in emerging technologies
- **Local communities and ecosystems** benefit as projects gain strength in their activities - healthier river systems, improved rural wellbeing, more vibrant cultural hubs
- **Funders and sponsors** benefit by seeing measurable impact and learning how their tools perform in real-world settings
- **Broader Web3 and ReFi ecosystem** benefits from lessons learned and open knowledge generated ‚Äì successful models can be replicated elsewhere, and any open-source technology developed becomes available to all

#### E. Intended outcomes
We seek both **tangible, measurable** short-term outcomes and **innovative** long-term methodological advances:
- **Tangible outcomes:** Educational workshops delivered, testing of web3 tools, research reports and other concrete deliverables enabled by funding which are currently being defined with the local partners, with concrete temporal windows and milestones; comprehensive set of **on-chain impact records** for each project (via Karma GAP); successful implementation of our phased funding distribution approach (design to be finalized with partners).
- **Innovative outcomes:** Proven structured evaluation methodology adapted from GG23 for bioregional contexts; improved understanding of how to run local funding rounds and embed web3 tools in cooperative environments; strengthened relationships between Catalan regenerative initiatives and global Web3 communities; open-source knowledge artifacts and replicable templates demonstrating "cosmo-local" funding approaches.

#### F. Success
Success looks like a cohort of value-aligned projects in Catalunya that not only accomplish their immediate goals with our funding, but also feel empowered to continue using these new tools ‚Äì accessing additional funding streams in the future, attracting supporters through greater transparency, and collaborating as a networked ecosystem.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Local Fundraising & Funds Usage [‚úÖ for form]**

#### A. Funding & Matching Structure
To maximize community buy-in, Regenerant Catalunya operates as a **collaborative funding effort between local and global stakeholders**:
1. **Local contributions:** Miceli Social and La Fundici√≥/Keras Buti contribute **‚Ç¨11,000** total (‚Ç¨6,000 + ‚Ç¨5,000 respectively)
2. **Global matching:** International partners provide **~$20,000** in matching funds
3. **Total matching pool:** ~‚Ç¨30,000 ($30k) serves as the matching pool for quadratic funding distribution

#### B. Distribution Strategy
The matching pool is intentionally sized to meaningfully support ~10 projects with our minimum threshold of **‚Ç¨1,000 per project** ensuring grants can fund concrete outcomes. We're exploring a **phased distribution approach** that could combine immediate allocation based on impact evaluation with potential follow-up rewards for continued engagement - the exact structure will be defined in collaboration with our local partners to best serve project needs. This "matching on matching" approach builds relationships between local philanthropists and global funders, seeding ongoing cooperation beyond this single round.

#### C. Operational Sustainability
Following Gitcoin's ["Fair Fee" model](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-fair-fees-for-gg24/22560), a small percentage of matching funds covers operational costs. This acknowledges that local coordination requires real resources and ensures the model remains replicable without relying purely on volunteerism. **Every stakeholder co-invests:** local community contributes funds and time, global sponsors contribute funds and technology, and ReFi BCN contributes coordination labor ‚Äì aligning incentives toward successful outcomes.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Impact Measurement & On-Chain Activity [‚úÖ for form]**

### A. Integration Requirements
All participating projects will be onboarded to a minimal web3 stack for reporting their activities & managing funds:

**Karma GAP - Activities & Impact Reporting:**
- **Karma GAP (Grantee Accountability Protocol)** is a platform enabling **on-chain progress updates and milestone publishing**, building transparent track records on the blockchain, logging activities, outputs, and outcomes.
- Projects will be onboarded to Karma GAP to report their activities & impact using **impact reporting guidelines** drawing from frameworks like the **Common Approach to Impact Measurement**.
- Instead of burying reports in PDFs, each project maintains a living, public "project resume" on the blockchain that **anyone can audit or learn from**.

**Web3 Wallet (on Celo) - Funds Management:**
- We will work with partners to identify the easiest solution for projects to open a wallet and manage receiving funds. Possibilities include: Valora, Minipay, Prosperity Pass, Metamask, Zerion, Rainbow and more.
- Projects will receive instruction on wallet management and secure funds handling.

### B. Impact Measurement & Evaluation
We will adopt and adapt the [methodology developed and implemented by Regen Coordination in GG23](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ai-impactqf-regen-coordination-global-gg23-retrospective/20385), which successfully evaluated and informed the allocation of a $96,000 matching pool of funds to 50 projects. The implementation should include:
- **Production of evaluation reports** based on project reports submitted through Karma GAP
- **Evaluation by council members** - human reviewers with relevant expertise, informed by the evaluation reports
- **Definition of allocations** based on evaluation scores, ensuring funding decisions align with demonstrated impact and project potential

**Evaluation Process:**
- Projects submit regular activity and impact reports through Karma GAP following Common Approach frameworks
- Council members systematically review reports and score projects according to criteria adapted for our bioregional context
- Final allocations are determined based on these evaluation scores, balancing impact demonstration with project needs

**Evaluation Criteria:** Building on proven methodologies while adapting them for the Catalan bioregional context, criteria will focus on areas such as: creating local ecological, social, and economic impact; demonstrating resource efficiency relative to funding; showing clear goals and progress toward objectives; aligning with bioregional regeneration and cooperative values; and contributing to ReFi Web3 awareness and adoption. The specific criteria and weighting will be **collaboratively defined with our local partners** (Miceli Social and La Fundici√≥ / Keras Buti) to ensure they appropriately reflect the values and priorities of Catalan regenerative work.

### C. Funds Distribution Strategy
We're exploring a **two-phase distribution approach** to be finalized with our local partners:

**Initial Distribution:**
- A portion of funds distributed after projects submit initial reports and these are evaluated by the council
- Project scores inform allocation decisions, with funds immediately available for project activities
- We provide support (without legal liabilities) to help projects with secure off-ramping as needed

**Follow-up Distribution:**
- Additional rewards for continued web3 integrations and longer-term engagement
- Funds potentially streamed over time according to continued participation and tool adoption
- Additional incentives available for implementing other tools in the round's toolkit (Silvi, Ecocerts/Hypercerts, Gainforest, Sarafu Commitment Pooling, etc.)
- We're exploring adopting Octant V2, Flowstate and/or Gardens for streaming mechanisms

**Current consideration:** We're initially exploring an approximately **50% / 50% split** between initial and follow-up distributions, though the exact proportions and structure will be collaboratively defined with our partners to ensure the approach best serves local project needs and aligns with the Local Funding Programs GG24's objectives.

### D. Regional On-Chain Impact Analysis
We aim to pilot **regional on-chain impact analysis** ‚Äì aggregating data to assess the round's overall Catalonia footprint by tracking new on-chain wallets created regionally, analyzing local versus external fund flows, monitoring environmental indicators and community engagement levels, and measuring Web3 tool adoption and retention rates across participating projects. This comprehensive data collection creates a template for attracting future funding while contributing to the broader Ethereum Localism movement with measurable local impact data.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Stakeholders [context for form]**

This section provides essential context about the collaborative network behind Regenerant Catalunya, showing the multi-stakeholder approach that combines local knowledge with global Web3 expertise.

The round is a collaborative effort between:

**A. ReFi Barcelona (ReFi BCN)** is the collective coordinating Regenerant Catalunya. We are a cooperative in formation, being incubated by and housed at Bloc4BCN, one of Europe's major coop hubs.

**B. Local Partners:** For Regenerant Catalunya, two Catalan organizations are anchoring the effort and co-funding the round:

- [**Miceli Social**](https://miceli.social/) ‚Äì a cooperative service hub within the social economy focused on rural resilience. Based in Ripoll (Girona), Miceli catalyzes regenerative development in rural areas by supporting municipalities and community groups. They have helped identify several candidate projects for this funding round (see below) and contributed ‚Ç¨6,000 to the matching pool. Miceli's involvement ensures the round is grounded in the needs of Catalonia's territory, tapping into ongoing efforts around ecological transition in rural comarcas (counties).

- **La Fundici√≥ / Keras Buti** ‚Äì a cultural and social innovation cooperative and official hub within the Xarxa d'Ateneus Cooperatius, based in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat in Barcelona's metropolitan area (Catalonia's second most populous municipality and one of Europe's densest). La Fundici√≥ / Keras Buti has committed ‚Ç¨5,000 to the matching pool and will invite projects from its networks‚Äîe.g., neighborhood initiatives around community spaces, cooperative housing, and cultural heritage. Their involvement brings a strong urban and peri-urban lens, linking the **urban commons** to a bioregional perspective; since 2006 they've run collective processes of knowledge-building and cultural practice, reimagining art and education as tools for feminist economics and local resilience.

**C. Global Partners & Funders:** The international sponsors backing Regenerant Catalunya represent some of the most socially-engaged communities in the blockchain space:

- **Global Partner - [Regen Coordination](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/) :** A global alliance weaving together local regenerative finance experiments into a coherent movement. It organizes decentralized funding rounds and toolkits that channel resources into ecological and community projects worldwide.

- **Global Funders:**
  - **Celo Public Goods:** Celo is a blockchain ecosystem designed for climate action and financial inclusion. Its Public Goods program supports regenerative initiatives that link digital finance with ecological and social impact, making money work for people and the planet.
  - **Gitcoin:** The leading Web3 funding platform for public goods, having distributed over $60M using mechanisms like quadratic funding.
  - **Ethereum Foundation:** The main steward of Ethereum's open-source ecosystem. By sponsoring localism experiments, it supports applying Ethereum tools ‚Äî from wallets to governance ‚Äî in real-world contexts, proving their value for civic life and regenerative economies.

For local partners, **Regenerant Catalunya** offers not only new resources and visibility, but also a hands-on opportunity to shape how these global tools work in practice. For the global sponsors, it's a two-way street as well: a chance to learn from Catalonia's rich tradition of cooperativism and environmental activism, and to **embed their technology in real communities** striving for resilience. In sum, this collaboration bridges local and global ‚Äì reflecting the cosmo-local ethos that knowledge and resources should circulate globally, but action is grounded locally.

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Mechanisms & Tooling [context for form]**

This section outlines the Web3 tools and mechanisms that will be used throughout the program, connecting directly to the **Integration Requirements** described in section 3Ô∏è‚É£. These tools support both the **impact measurement framework** and the **capacity-building workshops** mentioned in our Program Scope.

In terms of tools, Regenerant Catalunya will blend tried-and-tested Web3 tools with new experiments:

**Round Stack:**
- **Karma GAP** (Grantee Accountability Protocol): As described, this will be used for impact tracking. Each project will register on Karma GAP (creating an on-chain project profile) and commit to posting at least a few updates. This not only serves the impact goals, but also introduces them to the concept of **on-chain reputation** ‚Äì which could unlock future opportunities (for instance, a project that builds a strong track record on Karma might later use it to apply for other grants, since their impact is visible and verifiable).
- **Safe Multisig - Funds Management & Distribution: TBD**
- **Program Workspace - Notion:** We are exploring setting up a **collective dashboard or Notion** that aggregates social media and on-chain updates from all projects for easy following.
- **Communications Channel - WhatsApp:** Also, likely a chat group or Discord for all participants and supporters to share progress informally.

- **Optional Integrations Tools Stack:** Depending on each project's interest, we might pilot other ReFi & Web3 tools, which could also allow them to receive extra funds.
  - **Silvi:** a Web3-native platform for transparent, verifiable, and scalable tree planting and ecosystem restoration. It enables fractional funding, incremental verification, and data-rich tracking of individual trees and reforestation zones‚Äîdelivering a robust Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) stack that ensures every act of regeneration is captured and rewarded.
  - **Ecocerts & Hypercerts:** Impact certification and verification systems
  - **Gainforest:** AI-powered forest monitoring and restoration verification
  - **Sarafu Network - Commitment Pooling:** Local currency and commitment pooling experimentation
  - **Kokonut Network:** Kokonut Network is a decentralized ecosystem for building and deploying syntropic agroforestry farms using Web3 infrastructure. Its open-source framework allows communities to design farms optimized for diverse funding sources (grants, DAOs, cooperatives, investors) and impact outcomes (public goods, financial returns, or blended). Currently operating 2 live farms with 4 more in development across the Dominican Republic, Kokonut represents a powerful example of Web3 applied to real-world ecological and economic transformation.
