# REGENERANT CATALUNYA GG24 - PROGRAM DESIGN

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Status:** Final Design | **Phase:** Pre-Launch (Phase 2)

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Regenerant Catalunya** is a pioneering participatory funding round that demonstrates how local knowledge integrates with global Web3 infrastructure to create a replicable model for bioregional regeneration. Through collaboration between established Catalan partners ([Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/), [La Fundici√≥](https://lafundicio.net/)/[Keras Buti](https://kerasbuti.org/)) and global Web3 funders (Gitcoin, Celo, Ethereum Foundation), we're channeling **‚Ç¨30,000 into 10-12 carefully curated regenerative projects** across Catalonia.

**Launch Window:** October 14-28, 2025 (Gitcoin Grants Round 24)
