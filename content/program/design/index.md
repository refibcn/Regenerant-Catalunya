## üéØ Executive Summary

**Regenerant Catalunya** is a pioneering participatory funding round that demonstrates how local knowledge integrates with global Web3 infrastructure to create a replicable model for bioregional regeneration. Through collaboration between established Catalan partners ([Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/), [La Fundici√≥](https://lafundicio.net/)/[Keras Buti](https://kerasbuti.org/)) and global Web3 funders (Gitcoin, Celo, Ethereum Foundation), we're channeling **‚Ç¨30,000 into 10-12 carefully curated regenerative projects** across Catalonia.

**Launch Window:** October 14-28, 2025 (Gitcoin Grants Round 24)

## 1. Program Foundations

### 1.1 Vision Statement
To create a replicable model for bioregional regenerative finance that bridges local community needs with global Web3 infrastructure, demonstrating that blockchain technology can serve real regenerative work rather than speculation.

### 1.2 Core Principles

- Build within existing trusted ecosystems rather than imposing external solutions
- Leverage established relationships through Miceli Social (rural) and La Fundici√≥/Keras Buti (urban)
- Enable organic spread through well-established social infrastructures

**üîó Cosmo-Local Integration**
- Global resources and technology meet local knowledge and action
- Combine traditional cooperative values with cutting-edge Web3 tools
- Create templates for global adaptation while serving immediate local needs

**üéØ Depth Over Breadth**
- Focus on 10-12 carefully curated projects rather than casting a wide net
- Provide comprehensive support: funding + capacity building + mentorship
- Generate visible success stories that inspire wider adoption

### 1.3 Unique Value Proposition

**For Local Projects:**
- Access to amplified funding through quadratic funding mechanisms
- Capacity building in Web3 tools and impact measurement
