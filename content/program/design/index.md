- Enable organic spread through well-established social infrastructures

**🔗 Cosmo-Local Integration**
- Global resources and technology meet local knowledge and action
- Combine traditional cooperative values with cutting-edge Web3 tools
- Create templates for global adaptation while serving immediate local needs

**🎯 Depth Over Breadth**
