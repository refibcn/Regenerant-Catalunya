# Partners & Stakeholders

Regenerant Catalunya is a collaborative effort that bridges local and global – reflecting the cosmo-local ethos that knowledge and resources should circulate globally, but action is grounded locally. This multi-stakeholder approach combines local knowledge with global Web3 expertise to channel resources into Catalonia's regenerative projects.

## Program Coordinator

### ReFi Barcelona (ReFi BCN)

**ReFi Barcelona** is the collective coordinating Regenerant Catalunya. We are a cooperative in formation, being incubated by and housed at [Bloc4BCN](https://bloc4bcn.coop/), one of Europe's major cooperative hubs. Our role is to serve as the **connecting tissue** between local regenerative work and global Web3 infrastructure, ensuring blockchain tools serve real community needs rather than speculation.

## Local Partners

For Regenerant Catalunya, two Catalan organizations are anchoring the effort and co-funding the round:

### [Miceli Social](https://miceli.social/)

A cooperative service hub within the social economy focused on **rural resilience**. Based in Ripoll (Girona), Miceli catalyzes regenerative development in rural areas by supporting municipalities and community groups. They have helped identify several candidate projects for this funding round and contributed **€6,000** to the matching pool. Miceli's involvement ensures the round is grounded in the needs of Catalonia's territory, tapping into ongoing efforts around ecological transition in rural comarcas (counties).

**Contribution:** €6,000 matching pool + rural project curation  
**Website:** [miceli.social](https://miceli.social/)

### La Fundició / Keras Buti

A cultural and social innovation cooperative and official hub within the Xarxa d'Ateneus Cooperatius, based in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat in Barcelona's metropolitan area (Catalonia's second most populous municipality and one of Europe's densest). La Fundició / Keras Buti has committed **€5,000** to the matching pool and invited projects from its networks—e.g., neighborhood initiatives around community spaces, cooperative housing, and cultural heritage. Their involvement brings a strong urban and peri-urban lens, linking the **urban commons** to a bioregional perspective; since 2006 they've run collective processes of knowledge-building and cultural practice, reimagining art and education as tools for feminist economics and local resilience.

**Contribution:** €5,000 matching pool + urban project curation

## A Two-Way Bridge

For local partners, **Regenerant Catalunya** offers not only new resources and visibility, but also a hands-on opportunity to shape how these global tools work in practice. 

For the global sponsors, it's a two-way street as well: a chance to learn from Catalonia's rich tradition of cooperativism and environmental activism, and to **embed their technology in real communities** striving for resilience. 

This collaboration embodies the **cosmo-local** approach: knowledge and resources circulate globally, but action is grounded locally.
