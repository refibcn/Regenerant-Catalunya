## Form Introduction

### *TL;DR ‚Äî Who should fill this in?*

*If you're helping lead a local community / ecosystem hub (e.g., ReFi Local Node, Greenpill Chapter, bioregional org, municipal/NGO partnership, university program, or other locally rooted initiative) and want support + funding to run a locally-led Web3-based funding program, please register your interest here.*

*This aims to be a lightweight intake form to gauge the eligibility and readiness of your program for the planned GG24 Local Funding Programs round. You can (and are encouraged to) fill this form even if you might still need more time to raise local matching funds or finalize your program design. In that case, registering now helps us stay connected and support you in building toward future rounds (e.g. GG25 in March 2026), where we expect to have further funding available for local programs.*

***Note: All details here are preliminary pending the Gitcoin GG24 Dedicated Domain vote on 12 Sept 2025. Final round details and parameters will be published immediately after that vote. This form remains the first step to be considered for invitation.***

### *Context - Ethereum Localism & Regen Coordination?*

***Ethereum Localism** is a movement of people seeking to embed Ethereum's tools (stablecoins, payments, onchain governance, open data, community grants, impact credits, etc.) into place-based communities and economies. Instead of focusing on speculation, the aim is practical, durable utility‚Äîhelping neighborhoods, bioregions, campuses, and community hubs use Ethereum to coordinate resources, measure impact, and build resilient local economies. Each local implementation becomes an open-source blueprint that others can use and adapt.*

***Regen Coordination** is a global alliance of organizations and networks (including ReFi DAO, Greenpill Network, Bloom Network, BioFi, Ma Earth, AgroforestDAO, and more) dedicated to weaving and connecting these local experiments into a coherent movement. We convene funding rounds, sensemaking processes, and shared toolkits that make decentralized efforts more legible and coordinated. For GG24, Regen Coordination and Open Civics are leading the Local Funding Programs track, ensuring communities receive the guidance, tools, funding and support they need to run credible and impactful local programs‚Äîwhile documenting learnings that feed back into the global ecosystem.*

### **Eligibility & Selection ‚Äî What we‚Äôre looking for üëÄ**

*The planned **GG24 Local Funding Programs round** will support a small cohort of local hubs that can demonstrate how Ethereum can take root in real communities. While the outcomes we‚Äôre seeking are about growing adoption and utilization of Ethereum, local funding programs do not need to limit themselves to only funding Web3-native people or projects.*

*Depending on your program scope, you might choose to support a local selection of:*

*üåü¬†**Regenerative initiatives, NGOs & nonprofits** (ecological, social, cultural)*

*üåü¬†**Regional development or civics** (municipal pilots, community currencies, civic tech)*

*üåü¬†**Learning hubs & educational spaces** (schools, universities, community labs)*

*üåü¬†**Local developer communities** (hackathons, open-source contributors, Web3 builders)*

*üåü¬†**Creative & cultural projects** (arts, media, local storytelling, heritage)*

*üåü¬†**Entrepreneurship & local businesses** (incubators, SMEs experimenting with Web3 tools)*

*üåü ‚Ä¶and/or **Web3-aligned builders & communities** (ReFi nodes, DAOs, impact networks)*

*What matters most is that your program has a credible design, secures local buy-in and matching funds, and shows a clear pathway to create both real-world impact and meaningful onchain activity.*

*The following criteria will guide program eligibility and selection:*

***1Ô∏è‚É£ Program Scope & Theory of Change***

- *Clear who/what/why for your program: which activities or projects you‚Äôll fund, who benefits, and what outcomes you seek.*
- *A scope that is appropriately scaled to the potential size of the funding pool, with matching funds proportional to the number and type of projects you aim to support. For example, a modest pool should not aim to fund hundreds of projects, but could credibly support a targeted set of local initiatives.*
- *A feasible plan with milestones and the ability to launch by late 2025 (or Jan 2026 latest).*

***2Ô∏è‚É£ Local Fundraising (Matching on Matching)***

- *Minimum $5k raised/committed from outside sponsors (e.g. municipalities, NGOs, community partners, etc.).
- More initial funds raised = stronger proposal + more match potential.
- Target policy (current draft): up to 2√ó match on your local raise, capped at $20k per program (e.g., raise $10k locally ‚Üí up to $20k GG24 match = $30k total pool).
- You may include a [**Fair Fee**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-fair-fees-for-gg24/) to help cover the ops/admin of your program.*

***3Ô∏è‚É£ Impact Measurement & Onchain Activity***

- *Commitment to credible impact reporting (e.g., via tools like Karma GAP)*
- *Openness to pilot techniques for regional onchain impact analysis e.g. local web3 adoption, transactions, retention on Web3 rails etc...*

***4Ô∏è‚É£ Team Experience & Delivery Capability***

- *Ideally anchored by an existing local hub/chapter/coalition with trusted community / ecosystem relationships.
- Evidence you/your team has the experience, skills and capacity to design and run the local funding program: with appropriate program governance, outreach, partnerships, comms, treasury ops, reporting etc...*

***‚ùóÔ∏èNote: It‚Äôs completely fine if your program does not yet meet all of the above or is not yet fully developed or scoped ‚Äî we encourage you to use this form to share where things stand now and thus providing a starting point to help shape how the potential program could be further scoped and developed.***

***‚ùóÔ∏èNote 2: At this stage, you do  need to know exactly what allocation mechanism / tooling you would like to use to run your local program. There are multiple approaches available (e.g., quadratic funding, direct grants, retro, hybrid models), and we will support you in exploring the options, understanding their trade-offs, and selecting the design and tooling that best fits your local context and goals.***

## ***What happens after you submit this form?***

*1. We‚Äôll review interest forms on a rolling basis and provide feedback.*

*2. You‚Äôll shortly receive the final round brief, dates, and application processes.*

*3. Formal applications and initial funding round to take place in mid-October during GG24.*

*By submitting, you consent to us storing your responses for the purpose of program coordination across ETH FTW, Regen Coordination, and Open Civics. We will not share personal contact details publicly. You may be contacted to clarify details or invited to coordination calls.*

*Let‚Äôs grow üå±üëá*

## About your potential program üå±

*Please now provide high-level answers to the following questions to help us understand your potential local program scope and readiness. It‚Äôs completely fine if your program is not yet fully developed or scoped ‚Äî we encourage you to just share where things stand now. This will give us a baseline to understand your starting point and help shape how the potential program could be further scoped and developed.*

### Program Scope & Theory of Change

*What is the focus of your local program? (Who/what will you fund, why it matters, and the outcomes you hope to achieve?) How many projects or participants do you anticipate supporting, and how will you ensure the scope is right-sized for the resources you expect to raise?*

**Regenerant Catalunya is a participatory funding round channeling resources into projects regenerating life in the Catalan bioregion. We aim to fund 10-12 projects spanning ecological restoration, community health, education, sustainable tourism, and cooperative housing‚Äîfrom restoring ecosystems like the Fluvi√† River to strengthening community infrastructure in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat.**

**Our theory of change: By empowering a small group of exemplary projects with funding, technology, connections and knowledge, we generate visible success stories that inspire wider adoption of regenerative finance (ReFi) and Web3 mechanisms in Catalonia and beyond. Our approach is network-driven, introducing innovations gradually within trusted ecosystems through Miceli Social's rural resilience networks and La Fundici√≥'s urban cooperative fabric.**

**Target outcomes: Educational workshops delivered, comprehensive on-chain impact records (via Karma GAP), testing of web3 tools, and strengthened relationships between Catalan regenerative initiatives and global Web3 communities. Each project receives minimum ‚Ç¨1,000 to boost ongoing work and pilot Web3-related innovations.**

**The scope is right-sized for our ~‚Ç¨30,000 total pool (‚Ç¨11,000 local + ~$20,000 global match), ensuring meaningful support per project while maintaining depth over breadth for maximum learning and replicability.**

### Program Fundraising

*Who are your likely seeding co-funders (e.g., municipalities, NGOs, regional sponsors, ecosystem partners)? Have you already raised or secured any commitments?Do you plan to include Fair Fees to support program operations?*

**Local co-funders secured: We have confirmed commitments totaling ‚Ç¨11,000 from two established Catalan organizations:**

**‚Ä¢ Miceli Social (‚Ç¨6,000): A cooperative service hub focused on rural resilience, based in Ripoll (Girona), catalyzing regenerative development in rural areas through municipal and community group support.**

**‚Ä¢ La Fundaci√≥ (‚Ç¨5,000): A cultural and social innovation cooperative in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, official hub within the Xarxa d'Ateneus Cooperatius, linking urban commons to bioregional perspectives through feminist economics and local resilience.**

**These partners have already committed funds and helped identify/invite participating projects from their networks. Our target is ~$20,000 global matching from Gitcoin, Celo, and Ethereum Foundation partners, creating a total pool of ~‚Ç¨30,000.**

**Yes, we plan to include Fair Fees following Gitcoin's model to cover operational coordination costs, acknowledging that local coordination requires real resources and ensuring the model remains replicable.**

### Impact Measurement

*How might you measure the impact of your program and the projects you support?What kinds of metrics, outcomes, or stories would you aim to track and report on?Are you open to experimenting with Web3-based tools (e.g., Karma GAP for impact reporting or TVF tracking to measure onchain adoption and value flows)?*

**Yes, we are fully committed to experimenting with Web3-based impact measurement tools:**

**‚Ä¢ Karma GAP Integration: All participating projects will onboard to Karma GAP (Grantee Accountability Protocol) for on-chain progress updates and milestone publishing, creating transparent, auditable track records instead of buried PDF reports.**

**‚Ä¢ Impact Reporting Framework: We'll pair Karma GAP with impact reporting guidelines drawing from frameworks like the Common Approach, enabling projects to articulate not just what they did, but what changed as a result.**

**‚Ä¢ Regional Analysis Pilot: We aim to pilot regional on-chain impact analysis‚Äîaggregating data to assess the round's overall Catalonia footprint including new on-chain wallets created regionally, local vs. external fund flows, environmental indicators improved, and community members engaged.**

**Metrics we'll track: Educational workshops delivered, web3 tools tested/adopted, research reports produced, concrete deliverables with temporal milestones, enhanced project visibility, and strengthened relationships between local and global regenerative communities. We'll also document qualitative stories of transformation and innovation adoption.**

**This approach serves multiple purposes: rewarding accountability, providing funders real-time impact visibility, generating open data for analysis, and creating a template for future bioregional funding rounds.**

### Team Experience & Delivery Capability

*What relevant experience do you bring to running a funding program (e.g., governance, outreach, partnerships, treasury ops, reporting)? Who else would likely be on your program ops/delivery team?*

**Lead Team - ReFi Barcelona:**

**‚Ä¢ Luiz Fernando Segala Gomes (Technical/Financial Lead): Extensive experience in regenerative finance coordination and Web3 ecosystem development through ReFi DAO and Regen Coordination, working with governance, grants, and operational automation to cultivate resilient ecosystems.**

**‚Ä¢ Giulio Quarta (Process Lead): Community-builder and organizer with expertise in project management and community orchestration, maintaining alignment between stakeholders and helping projects gain visibility beyond immediate networks.**

**‚Ä¢ Andrea Far√≠as (Program Design/Communications): Researcher, designer, and facilitator with years of experience in product and program innovation, specializing in tools and processes that strengthen communities during planetary crisis.**

**Delivery Capabilities: Our team covers program design, community outreach, technical integration, communications, treasury management (multi-signature wallets via Gnosis Safe), and reporting. We operate through both local channels (Catalan/Spanish via partner networks) and global channels (English via ReFi DAO and Regen Coordination).**

**Advisors: Oriol (Miceli Social - rural resilience expertise), Maril√≥ (La Fundici√≥/Keras Buti - urban cooperative economics), plus additional ecosystem collaborators being finalized.**

**Governance: Established collaborative decision-making between ReFi BCN and local partners through deliberative meetings, combining local trust with global expertise for credible execution and long-term community capacity building.**

### Community Reference & Social Proof (optional)

*If your community is less well known to Gitcoin or Regen Coordination ecosystems, please list 1‚Äì3 people who could act as high-reputation references for you.*

- *These should ideally be individuals outside your direct project/team (though they may be ecosystem collaborators).*
- *They should have established credibility or reputation (e.g., a recognized community leader, academic, funder, NGO partner, or Web3 ecosystem steward).*
- *Their role would simply be to vouch for your credibility and work, providing verifiable social proof if needed.*

*Name, Contact Info / Social Media, Relationship to your community*

**Given our established presence in the ReFi DAO and Regen Coordination ecosystems through Luiz's work, we have good visibility. However, local references can include:**

**‚Ä¢ Oriol (Miceli Social): Rural resilience expert and municipal collaboration specialist, representing our key rural Catalan partner organization**

**‚Ä¢ Maril√≥ (La Fundici√≥/Keras Buti): Urban cooperative economics and cultural innovation expert, representing our key urban Catalan partner organization**

**‚Ä¢ [Additional ecosystem references to be confirmed - potentially from Resilience Earth, Culture Hack Labs, or other established Catalan regenerative organizations]**

### Any other relevant info, ideas or feedback to share?

**Timeline & Readiness: We are well-positioned for October 2025 launch, having completed Phase 1 (stakeholder alignment) and currently in Phase 2 (program design). Projects are identified and committed, funding commitments secured, and we're finalizing operational details.**

**Unique Value: Regenerant Catalunya represents a rare convergence of established local regenerative networks (with deep community trust) and global Web3 expertise. Catalonia's rich cooperative tradition and active Social Solidarity Economy provide ideal fertile ground for demonstrating how blockchain tools can serve real community needs rather than speculation.**

**Learning Focus: Beyond just funding projects, we're documenting the entire process to create open-source templates for other bioregional rounds. This includes lessons on balancing local cultural context with global technical standards, managing multilingual coordination, and integrating Web3 tools into traditional cooperative structures.**

**Replication Potential: Our "cosmo-local" approach‚Äîwhere global resources and tech meet local knowledge and action‚Äîis designed to be adaptable to other bioregions worldwide, making this a valuable pilot for the broader Ethereum Localism movement.**
