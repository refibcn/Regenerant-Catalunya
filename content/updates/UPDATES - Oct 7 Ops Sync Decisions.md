# REGENERANT CATALUNYA GG24 - UPDATES FROM OCT 7 OPS SYNC

**Meeting Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Updated:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** Key decisions made, implementation required

---

## üéØ KEY DECISIONS MADE

### **1. Communication Tools - CONFIRMED ‚úÖ**

**WhatsApp Groups - APPROVED**
- ‚úÖ **Decision:** Use WhatsApp for program coordination
- ‚úÖ **Structure:** Minimum 2 separate groups required:
  - **Group 1:** Projects group (all 12 projects + ReFi BCN team)
  - **Group 2:** Local partners/council group (Oriol, Maril√≥, ReFi BCN team)
- **Action Required:** Create groups by October 10
- **Owner:** Giulio

**Notion Usage - MINIMAL APPROACH ‚úÖ**
- ‚úÖ **Decision:** Use Notion but keep it simple
- ‚úÖ **Approach:** 
  - One-pagers only (like Google Docs)
  - NOT comprehensive project management databases
  - Document-focused, not workflow-focused
  - Easy migration to public Flowershow when needed
  - Email-based access for participants (no complex onboarding)
- **Implication:** The full 53-entry database I created is NOT the approach
- **Alternative:** Create simple one-page documents instead
- **Action Required:** Adjust Notion strategy by October 10
- **Owner:** Giulio + Andrea

---

### **2. Entity Naming - PENDING CONFIRMATION ‚è≥**

**Decision Discussion:**
- Options considered: La Fundici√≥ vs. Kerasbuti vs. La Col¬∑lectiva
- **Preference:** La Fundici√≥ (better institutional credibility, better website)
- **Status:** Pending confirmation with Maril√≥/stakeholders
- **Concern:** Maril√≥ may prefer Kerasbuti and "is not flexible"

**Current Usage in Documents:**
- Most docs say "La Fundici√≥ / Keras Buti"
- Some just say "La Fundici√≥"

**Action Required:**
- ‚úÖ Julio to confirm entity naming with stakeholders ASAP
- Update all documents once confirmed
- Use for: Partnership agreements, public communications, Gitcoin registration

**Recommended Approach Until Confirmed:**
Continue using "La Fundici√≥ / Keras Buti" in all materials to be safe

---

### **3. Funding Process & Timeline - CLARIFIED ‚úÖ**

**‚Ç¨5,000 from La Fundici√≥/Kerasbuti:**
- ‚úÖ **Process confirmed:** Through Julio's freelance invoice
- ‚úÖ **Flow:** 
  1. Julio receives ‚Ç¨5k via freelance invoice
  2. Personal donation to program (tax manageable for Julio's situation)
  3. B2B conversion to crypto
  4. Send to Demo6/Safe Multisig
- **Timeline:** Can be done next week (before end of Oct 13)
- **Owner:** Julio

**‚Ç¨6,000 from Miceli Social:**
- **Status:** Compromiso/agreement drafted but needs editing
- Missing details that need to be added
- **Action:** Julio to finalize and send back
- **Owner:** Julio

**Global Matching Funds (~$20k):**
- ‚úÖ **Gitcoin response expected:** October 28th
- ‚úÖ **Funds available:** Mid-to-late October
- ‚úÖ **Critical requirement:** Need local funds ON-RAMPED by end of October
- ‚úÖ **Distribution timing:** Matching funds distributed once local funds are on-chain
- **No formal compromiso needed** from Gitcoin/Celo/ETH Foundation for most funds
- Only Milwaukee (large individual contributor) might require agreement

**Updated Timeline:**
- **Oct 9-13:** Julio processes ‚Ç¨5k (freelance invoice ‚Üí crypto ‚Üí multisig)
- **Oct 9-13:** Finalize Miceli compromiso
- **Mid-Oct:** Gitcoin platform opens, funds become available

## üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR PLANNING

- This is critical for receiving global matching
- Process is clearer now: Julio handles ‚Ç¨5k conversion, simpler than expected

**3. Simpler Tools Approach**
- Don't overcomplicate Notion
- Use WhatsApp as primary coordination (already familiar to everyone)
- Save energy for program execution, not tool complexity

**4. Regular Cadence Established**
- Weekly Thursdays internal (starting Oct 20)
- Biweekly with partners (starting late Oct)
- More sustainable than ad-hoc scrambling

**5. Entity Naming Still Open**
- Don't finalize any public materials with specific entity name yet
- Wait for Julio's confirmation with Maril√≥
- Use "La Fundaci√≥ / Keras Buti" in interim documents
