## 📋 MINIMAL VIABLE DATABASE (MVP)

If time is constrained, create a **simplified version first** with just critical items:

### **MVP Properties (6 instead of 12):**
1. Task/Component (Title)
2. Priority (Select: 🔴 Critical, 🟠 High, 🟡 Medium)
3. Status (Select: Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
4. Owner (Person: Luiz, Giulio, Andrea)
5. Due Date (Date)
6. Notes (Text)

### **MVP Entries (15 instead of 53):**

**Just add these 15 critical tasks:**

1. ⚠️ Safe Multisig Wallet Setup - Luiz - Oct 9
2. ⚠️ ReFi BCN Project #12 Finalization - Giulio - Oct 9
3. ⚠️ Gitcoin Platform Registration - Giulio - Oct 11-12
4. ⚠️ Program Branding & Logo - Andrea - Oct 9

13. 🟠 Social Media Content - Andrea - Oct 9-13
14. 🟠 Project Spotlights (12) - Andrea - Oct 11
15. 🟠 Donor Journey Content - Andrea - Oct 11

### **MVP Views (2 instead of 6):**
1. **Table View:** All tasks sorted by Due Date
2. **Board View:** Grouped by Status
