# GitHub Pages Environment Protection Fix

## Issue

Your deployment is failing with this error:
```
Branch "main" is not allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules.
```

This happens because GitHub has created a `github-pages` environment with branch protection that doesn't include the `main` branch.

---

## Quick Fix (Recommended)

### Option 1: Update GitHub Pages Source Settings

1. Go to: https://github.com/refibcn/Regenerant-Catalunya/settings/pages
2. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Change from "Deploy from a branch" to "**GitHub Actions**"
3. Save the settings

This allows the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy directly without branch restrictions.

---

### Option 2: Add `main` Branch to Environment Protection

1. Go to: https://github.com/refibcn/Regenerant-Catalunya/settings/environments
2. Click on **github-pages** environment
3. Under "Deployment branches and tags":
   - Click "Add deployment branch or tag rule"
   - Select "**Selected branches and tags**"
   - Add a rule for branch: `main`
   - Click "Add rule"
4. Save changes

---

### Option 3: Remove Environment Protection (Not Recommended for Production)

1. Go to: https://github.com/refibcn/Regenerant-Catalunya/settings/environments
2. Click on **github-pages** environment
3. Scroll to bottom and click "**Delete environment**"
4. The next deployment will recreate it without protection rules

## Verify the Fix

After applying one of the options above, trigger a new deployment:

### Method 1: Make a small change and push
```bash
cd "/Users/luizfernando/Desktop/git/Zettelkasten/03 Libraries/Regenerant-Catalunya"
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment after GitHub Pages config"
git push origin main
```

### Method 2: Re-run the failed workflow
```bash
gh run rerun 18444716164 --repo refibcn/Regenerant-Catalunya
```

Or via the GitHub UI:
- Go to: https://github.com/refibcn/Regenerant-Catalunya/actions/runs/18444716164
- Click "Re-run all jobs"

---

## Check Deployment Status

```bash
gh run list --repo refibcn/Regenerant-Catalunya --limit 3
```

Or view on GitHub:
- https://github.com/refibcn/Regenerant-Catalunya/actions

## Expected Success

Once fixed, you should see:
```
âœ“ build in ~30s
âœ“ deploy in ~5s
```

Your site will then be live at: **https://regenerant.refibcn.cat** ðŸŽ‰
